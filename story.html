I am a teacher, and I loved my job for over two decades. Interacting with children was the most fulfilling thing in my life. But one day, on my way to school, I met with an accident where I injured my left leg.
I suffered from a non-healing ulcer which was treated, and I had 2 Schanz pins put in my leg which got infected over time. Gradually, the underlying muscle and bone got exposed and there was continuous pus discharge; this was my condition for the next 12-13 years of my life. I wasn’t fully able to enjoy what I loved doing the most. One day, after reading about Medicare success stories with complex cases, I decided to make a visit.
Dr. Srikanth Varma, an ace microsurgeon took up my case. They said that I required a rare surgical intervention, following which a sequestrectomy was performed on me.
I more than recovered from my hell of over 12 years. I am back to the job I love with fresh zeal to teach and mould children – I have never been happier.

I was used to the life of multitasking for my family and would be on several chores at once. That was just my routine, but one night after having made dinner, I felt an ache on the left side of my neck. I tried to use analgesics but the pain lasted over a week.
When my pain intensified, my husband took me to our family physician who recommended Medicare as I needed quality tertiary care.
At Medicare, Dr. Amarendra Singh conducted further advanced investigations. They found irregularities in my heart, especially the aorta, and the doctor realised that I was at mortal risk with every passing minute. I was taken on cardiopulmonary bypass support and the aortic dissection was repaired with a prosthetic graft replacement. They monitored me closely and carefully weaned me off the ventilator the next day.
The surgery was a success. My blood profile was stabilised and I was discharged after a week. Reuniting with my family has been indescribable and I couldn’t be happier.

    Shweta, 29, Engineer

 <p>
When I was younger, I was diagnosed with Glanzmann’s Thrombasthenia, a rare form of bleeding disorder. Despite my impediments, I graduated as an engineer, got into a beautiful marriage and had just started planning for a family.
However, fate would have it that I would have to face a few more obstacles. I went into the ER at Medicare with abdominal pain. The ultrasound revealed a large ovarian cyst of 8 cm and Dr. Anuradha advised a laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy. Although it was a regularly performed surgery, my pre-existing condition complicated the situation. They anticipated excessive bleeding, and prepared themselves with Fresh Frozen Plasma and platelets. Transfusions were done before and during surgery. Gradually, my blood profile was stabilised and I was discharged after 4 days.
With the new hope given by the doctors, I have not given up on starting a family. I am presently undergoing treatment for infertility at the Medicare Fertility Centre.
