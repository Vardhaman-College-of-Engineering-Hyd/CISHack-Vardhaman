   <h2 style="border:2px solid Violet;">
   HEALTHCARE IS A RIGHT TO ALL, NOT A PRIVILEGE OF A FEW.
   </h2>
   <p>
   We have spent many decades in building a balance between the social and commercial sides of medicine, taking hard decisions between profit and impact. But the choice becomes easy with the goal of patient care, to ensure our work reaches remote areas where quality medicine is yet to be introduced.
   </p>
   <h2 style="border:2px solid Violet;">
   GREAT TECHNOLOGY ALONE CANNOT BATHE ANSWER.
   </h2>
   <p>
    Our website are fully equipped with the latest in medical technology.
    But we believe healthcare is more than quality technology it is service with patience.
   </p>
   <h2 style="border:2px solid Violet;">
   OUR CAPITAL IS BUILT UPON A SYSTEM OF VALUES.
   </h2>
   <p>
   It took us discipline, focus and sacrifice, along with compassion and empathyto successfullytreat five lakh patients, annually. We at Medicare strongly believe that healthcare is a business of trust.

        At Medicare, we have always believed in providing world-class clinical care at affordable prices. 
        Quality and patient experience have been topmost on our list of priorities, allowing us to deliver exceptional levels of service.
        Through our journey spanning two and a half decades, we have come across several cases that have pushed the limits of
        medical expertise; cases that would have, to put it mildly, tested the capabilities of even the finest healthcare providers.
        It is a matter of pride and immense professional satisfaction that our team of physicians and other care providers has consistently 
        managed to achieve near-impossible results.
